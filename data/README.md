     - /out_gmm/: output folder for word segmentation results by latticelm  
     - index?.csv: the category number of spatial concepts and position distributions in ?-th particle (? is the number of particles)
     - mu?.csv: mean vectors of the position distribution 　
     - particle?.csv: particle information (the number of steps, particle ID, x coordinate of the robot, y coordinate of the robot, orientation of the robot, log likelihood, particle ID in previous step, index of spatial concept, index of position distribution)
